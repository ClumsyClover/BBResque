## About -

### With the recent announcement of the university switching over to the Canvas LMS from Sem 1 2022, all university students were advised to download their course material etc. from the BlackBoard LMS.

### Downloading all your files from Blackboard could become tiring as you would go about navigating through all your folders, clicking on every single file (maybe twice) to in order to download it. Moreover, you would then also have to arrange all those files into folders on your PC or the cloud.
### BBResque does all this for you in just a few clicks. Follow the steps below to see how.
